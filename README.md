**Utility Belt** will solve your inventory clutter issues. 9 hotbar slots are not enough, especially when playing with mods. Wearing a Utility Belt gives you a second hotbar where only tools and weapons can be stored.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Craft** a Utility Belt using the recipe above.
2. **Equip** it in your belt slot.
3. **Fill** it with your tools and weapons.
