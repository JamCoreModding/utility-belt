- (feat) compat with LambDynamicLights
  - When LambDynamicLights is installed, you will be able to put light sources into your Utility Belt and they will illuminate the world around you.
  - If you have suggestions for other dynamic lights mods to add compat for, please open an issue on GitHub.
  - Closes #56
- (fix) issue when unequipping belt while you are using it
- (fix) general stability improvements
- (fix) the belt will now pop out all of its items when it is broken
  - This means that Netherite tools will not be lost if the belt burns in lava
- (feat) add X/Y offset config options for the belt hotbar for more granular control over its position
